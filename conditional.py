"""
You are helping a restaurant in Jos implement an automated discount system for their weekend promo.

The rules are:
Customers with a loyalty card get a 10% discount.
If the customer's order amount is above 20,000 NGN:
Loyalty card holders get an additional 5% discount.
Non-loyalty card holders get a free soft drink instead.
Students (verified with student ID) get an extra 5% discount on top of whatever they qualify for.

Customer data is stored in a dictionary like this:

customer = {
    "name": "Godiya",
    "order_amount": 25000,
    "loyalty_card": True,
    "is_student": False
}

Write a nested if-else block that:
Calculates the final discount or freebie for the customer.
Stores the result in a dictionary called order_summary.
Prints out a summary for the cashier.
